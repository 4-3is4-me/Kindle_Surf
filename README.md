# Kindle Surf

Surf conditions for the Kindle to display as a screensaver, here on a K4NT. Scraped from the undocumented Surf Line API. Magic Seaweed didn't have any developer API key avaibility.

Unofficial Surf Line API docs exist, for example https://github.com/swrobel/meta-surf-forecast

Kindle bash scripts altered from https://github.com/scolby33/weather_kindle

Custom screensavers and other Kindle 4NT hacking on https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/Kindle4NTHacking

2nd Kindle bought for static display, just need to decide where to put it up.
